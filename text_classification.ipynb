The fashions of the 80's - shoulder pads, sequins, and polyester - just top it off. The huge hair, the high heels, and the histrionics - what a combination.<br /><br />And all the actors just go to town, chewing up their parts and spitting them out in a big well scripted pile. Sally, Kevin, Elisabeth - wonderful! Whoopi - great! Robert Downey - refreshing to see him back when he had such potential, before the tabloids. And Garry: why did we have to wait so long to see him on film? Leesa Gibbons - hadn't been missing her, but nice to include her as a real life entertainment reporter (and where do you apply for THAT job, anyway?).<br /><br />Admittedly, I could have done without Sally climbing the drainpipe. Lucy Ricardo did it, how many times?, as has every comedienne from Carol Burnett to I don't know who and I'm so done with it now, I could spit peanuts if I had them. Apparently it's what you do when you're being funny in a tall building in New York. I'm just thankful they didn't pull out the flagpole bit.<br /><br />But it was cute, it was funny, it had plot twists, it had an after credits ending before that was common, it had clothes worthy of a second glance, it had a great cast and it's got personal memories for me. Really, what more do you need?\n"

Most of the scenes in this movie had me sitting there in stunned silence because the movie wasn\\'t all that funny. There are a few laughs in the film, but when you watch a comedy, you expect to laugh a lot more than a few times and that\\'s all this film has going for it.

His first movie 'House of Games' was the one I liked best, and it set a series of films with characters whose perspective of life changes as they get into complicated situations, and so does the perspective of the viewer.<br /><br />So is 'Homicide' which from the title tries to set the mind of the viewer to the usual crime drama. The principal characters are two cops, one Jewish and one Irish who deal with a racially charged area. The murder of an old Jewish shop owner who proves to be an ancient veteran of the Israeli Independence war triggers the Jewish identity in the mind and heart of the Jewish detective.<br /><br />This is were the flaws of the film are the more obvious. The process of awakening is theatrical and hard to believe, the group of Jewish militants is operatic, and the way the detective eventually walks to the final violent confrontation is pathetic. The end of the film itself is Mamet-like smart, but disappoints from a human emotional perspective.<br /><br />Joe Mantegna and William Macy give strong performances, but the flaws of the story are too evident to be easily compensated.\"\n",

Ring a bell, anyone? Now, a little boy named Derek heard a knock at the door one evening, and opened it to find a present on the doorstep for him. Even though it said \"don\\'t open till Christmas\", he begins to open it anyway but is stopped by his dad, who scolds him and sends him to bed, and opens the gift himself. Inside is a little red ball that sprouts Santa arms and a head, and proceeds to kill dad. Oops, maybe he should have left well-enough alone. Of course Derek is then traumatized by the incident since he watched it from the stairs, but he doesn\\'t grow up to be some killer Santa, he just stops talking.<br /><br />There\\'s a mysterious stranger lurking around, who seems very interested in the toys that Joe Petto makes. We even see him buying a bunch when Derek\\'s mom takes him to the store to find a gift for him to bring him out of his trauma. And what exactly is this guy doing? Well, we\\'re not sure but he does seem to be taking these toys apart to see what makes them tick. He does keep his landlord from evicting him by promising him to pay him in cash the next day and presents him with a \"Larry the Larvae\" toy for his kid, but of course \"Larry\" is not a good toy and gets out of the box in the car and of course, well, things aren\\'t pretty.<br /><br />Anyway, eventually what\\'s going on with Joe Petto and Pino is of course revealed, and as with the old story, Pino is not a \"real boy\". Pino is probably even more agitated and naughty because he suffers from \"Kenitalia\" (a smooth plastic crotch) so that could account for his evil ways. And the identity of the lurking stranger is revealed too, and there\\'s even kind of a happy ending of sorts. Whee.<br /><br />A step up from part 4, but not much of one. Again, Brian Yuzna is involved, and Screaming Mad George, so some decent special effects, but not enough to make this great. A few leftovers from part 4 are hanging around too, like Clint Howard and Neith Hunter, but that doesn\\'t really make any difference. Anyway, I now have seeing the whole series out of my system. Now if I could get some of it out of my brain. 4 out of 5.', shape=(), dtype=string)\n",

This is an example of overfitting: the model performs better on the training data than it does on data it has never seen before.

    "\n",
    "This tutorial showed how to train a binary classifier from scratch on the IMDB dataset. As an exercise, you can modify this notebook to train a multiclass classifier to predict the tag of a programming question on [Stack Overflow](http://stackoverflow.com/).\n",
    "\n",
    "We have prepared a [dataset](http://storage.googleapis.com/download.tensorflow.org/data/stack_overflow_16k.tar.gz) for you to use containing the body of several thousand programming questions (for example, \"How can sort a dictionary by value in Python?\") posted to Stack Overflow. Each of these is labeled with exactly one tag (either Python, CSharp, JavaScript, or Java). Your task is to take a question as input, and predict the appropriate tag, in this case, Python. \n",
    "\n",
    "The dataset you will work with contains several thousand questions extracted from the much larger public Stack Overflow dataset on [BigQuery](https://console.cloud.google.com/marketplace/details/stack-exchange/stack-overflow), which contains more than 17 million posts.\n",
    "\n",
    "After downloading the dataset, you will find it has a similar directory structure to the IMDB dataset you worked with previously:\n",

    "......1.txt\n",
    "...csharp/\n",

    "...java/\n",
    "......0.txt\n",
    "......1.txt\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Note: to increase the difficulty of the classification problem, we have replaced any occurences of the words Python, CSharp, JavaScript, or Java in the programming questions with the word *blank* (as many questions contain the language they're about). \n",
    "\n",
    "To complete this exercise, you should modify this notebook to work with the Stack Overflow dataset by making the following modifications:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. At the top of your notebook, update the code that downloads the IMDB dataset with code to download the [Stack Overflow dataset](http://storage.googleapis.com/download.tensorflow.org/data/stack_overflow_16k.tar.gz) we have prepreared. As the Stack Overflow dataset has a similar directory structure, you will not need to make many modifications. \n",
    "\n",
    "1. Modify the last layer of your model to read `Dense(4)`, as there are now four output classes.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. When you compile your model, change the loss to `losses.SparseCategoricalCrossentropy`. This is the correct loss function to use for a multiclass classification problem, when the labels for each class are integers (in our case, they can be 0, *1*, *2*, or *3*).\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Once these changes are complete, you will be able to train a multiclass classifier. \n",
    "\n",
    "If you get stuck, you can find a solution [here](https://github.com/tensorflow/examples/blob/master/community/en/text_classification_solution.ipynb).\n"
